# RSSI-Dataset-for-Indoor-Localization-Fingerprinting
RSSI dataset collected in LOKKOM project

The data set contains coherent data collected in various buildings using the same methodology in three different buildings 
belonging to Warsaw University of Technology: Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science (mini), Faculty of Physics (gf) 
and Main building of Warsaw University of Technology (gg).

The data were collected in two independent and separated  series between 07.2014 and 10.2014. The previous series was used as the learning set. 
The later series created the testing set. The location fingerprints in each of the two series create mostly a $1.5\times 1.5$ m grid. 
The grid was sparser when it was forced by the building's structureâ€”walls or different obstacles. 
Both series cover the same building area and the corresponding points from the learning and testing series are shifted by 0.75 m 
in each direction to avoid an intersection. 

The data were collected using the Android application created for the LOKKOM project https://www.researchgate.net/project/LOKKOM
and operated on three different models of mobile phones with Android OS 2.1: HTC One, LG Nexus4, and Sony Xperia.
During the measurements, the phones were transported and rotated on a trolley. The measurements have been done in four directions parallel 
to the building axes. Its purpose is to consider the power absorption of the human body (operator). 
Therefore, there were 40 fingerprints taken at every measurement point, ten in each direction.
